            <p>something ever happens, and we’re not together, I want you to know that you are brave, strong, intelligent, passionate, caring, and generous. You give so much to everyone around you and I know there are times when you feel like you’re less than you are—not strong enough or not around enough—but you are so much more than you know. You inspire me each and every day.

Long paragraphs for him
From the moment I first saw you, I knew that we were going to have something special. It was just how when we came together, we found ourselves in our own world. I feel like the words I say to you are so much more real than anything I’ve ever said to anyone else. You put color into my world. I feel like I’ve become a better person because of you, better able to love and care for other people in my life. You are so inspiring, and it’s always too long until I see you again. I love you more than you can know.

Sometimes you and I seem like a wild dream, but it’s a dream I want to come true. It seems so impossible. That I should find you, the one other person in this world who fits me so completely and who makes me so happy. Sometimes when we’re together, I’ll look over and you’ll be doing something small—something silly like looking for something to eat in the fridge or scratching your back maybe—and that one small thing causes this surge in my heart. I can’t believe I’m the person who gets to share these moments with you, these small, seemingly insignificant moments. I never thought this would be what my wildest dream would be like, but I’m so glad they’ve come true.
